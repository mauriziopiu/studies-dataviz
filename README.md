# studies-dataviz

Small Data Visualisation Project on my Studies.

## Usage

It's a simple web application. I think you should be able to run it.
I'm using Vanilla JavaScript and d3.js for the data visualisation (minimal overhead).

Should you want to feed your own data into this, the block-comment at the top of main.js describes the datamodel that I'm working with. Although it is fitted to my study program, adjustments for other programs should be possible. Same goes for the module-group attribute, these will obviously differ for any program other than mine.

## Usage Rights, License & Disclaimer

**You may** freely use, adjust/modify and share this code (and resulting visualisations) with other people - as long as you mention me as the original author. If you publicly share adaptations of this work, you have to do it under the same license.
**You may not** make money with the code in this repository. If you think you have figured out a way to monetize this code, contact me and we will figure out some solution.

Basically the CC-BY-NC-SA license. I might update this text as soon as I find the actually appropriate license that says all the stuff from above.

Disclaimer: I am a human being, I do make errors. I absolutely do not guarantee that this code is safe to run. There might be problems that come up as a result of using/running code that I wrote: your computer breaks, you hurt yourself or others because of it, ..., idk. If you choose to use/run my code, you agree that I am not liable for any problems or other bad situations that occur because of it. Entirely on you.

All that said, I hope you have fun with my code. If you have any contributions, do it in the usual github ways (pull request yadayadayada...).
